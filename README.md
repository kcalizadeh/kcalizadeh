# Hello! :)

My name is Kourosh Alizadeh and I'm a data science student at Flatiron School. Originally from the UK and of Persian descent, I hold a PhD in philosophy and have a strong background in education and research. Still getting the hang of transitioning from academia to code, but excited to keep learning.
