# Hello! :)

My name is Kourosh Alizadeh and I'm a data science student at Flatiron School. Originally from the UK and of Persian descent, I hold a PhD in philosophy and have a strong background in education and research. Still getting the hang of transitioning from academia to code, but excited to keep learning.

#### Code Stuff

🌱 Currently learning TensorFlow & working on Scikit-Learn fluency
🔭 Working on NLP with Hegel and other philosophy texts
👯 Would love to collaborate on Tensorflow projects or <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; research on data in the liberal arts; feel free to reach out :)

#### Other Stuff 
 :books: Toontoony the Magpie, a book of (very) short stories I wrote
 :cherry_blossom: aslidsiksoraksi.com, a blog of my writing, philosophy, and visual art
