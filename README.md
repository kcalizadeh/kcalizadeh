# Hello! :)

My name is Kourosh Alizadeh and I'm a data science student at Flatiron School. Originally from the UK and of Persian descent, I hold a PhD in philosophy and have a strong background in education and research. Still getting the hang of transitioning from academia to code, but excited to keep learning.

### Code Stuff

🌱 Currently learning TensorFlow & working on Scikit-Learn fluency<br>
🔭 Working on NLP with Hegel and other philosophy texts; also on modeling dialectical logic with Deep Learning<br>
👯 Would love to collaborate on Tensorflow projects or research on data in the liberal arts; feel free to reach out :)

### Other Stuff
 :books: Toontoony the Magpie, a book of (very) short stories I wrote<br>
 :cherry_blossom: [aslidsiksoraksi.com](aslidsiksoraksi.com), a blog of my writing, philosophy, and visual art<br>
 :black_nib: currently working on a book of systematic philosophy, though that's a good ways off :thinking: <br>

Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:kcalizadeh@gmail.com), LinkedIn, or whatever else you like. I do have a personal website if you want to learn more - [kcalizadeh.com](kcalizadeh.com)<br>
Thanks!
